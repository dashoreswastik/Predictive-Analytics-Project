# Predictive-Analytics-Project

The project contains 4 ipynb files. <br>



Three different ways for face detection has been used.<br>

First Method is by using SVM classifier. Second using CNN model.Third using Viola-Jones method.<br>

ALL the three methods have been performed on two different datasets, LFW and Yale Face datasets.<br>

`LFW face detection using SVM.ipynb ` contains non-CNN based method for Face Detection.

`face_detection_using_CNN_and_Viola_Jones_algorithm_with_the_lfw_dataset.ipynb` contains code for CNN model and Viola-Jones method on LFW dataset.

`Viola-Jones Detection on YALE.ipynb` contains code for Viola-Jones method on YALE face dataset.

`yale_face_detection_using_SVM_and_CNN_approach.ipynb` contains code for CNN and non-CNN based models on YALE face Dataset.
